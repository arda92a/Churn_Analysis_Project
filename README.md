And our aim is to first understand our dataset better by doing a detailed data analysis, analyze the customers who have left, and make important decisions about the future of the company with some visualizations. Then, by establishing various machine learning algorithms, to predict whether a customer will leave the bank and to take some precautions accordingly.
